        <h2>Why We Chose This Topic</h2>
        <p>We decided to focus on student mental health because it’s a growing issue that affects many young people today. As students ourselves, it's interesting to analyse these stats because they show patterns we might not notice otherwise. Looking at how mental health issues vary between genders gives us a better understanding of what might be affecting students differently.</p>

        <h2>Why Student Mental Health is Important</h2>

        <h2>Pivot Table: Panic Attacks by Gender</h2>
        <div class="pivot-table">
            <img src="panicattack.jpg" alt="Pivot table showing panic attacks by gender">

        <h2>Pivot Table: Treatment vs No Treatment</h2>
        <div class="pivot-table">
            <img src="treatment.jpg" alt="Pivot table showing treatment vs no treatment">
        </div>
        <p>This pivot table shows the mental health status of students based on whether they are receiving treatment. Most students don’t report mental health issues or treatment. However, for those with problems, treatment often proves beneficial. A small number of students continue to struggle with anxiety and panic attacks despite receiving treatment.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Differences in Mental Health</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, this project shows how mental health problems like anxiety, depression, and panic attacks affect students differently based on their gender. The data also shows that treatment helps many students, but some still face challenges even with treatment. This shows how important it is to make sure students can get the help they need to stay healthy and do well in school.</p>
